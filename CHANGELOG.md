## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Typed superset event model for Claude Code transcripts: `UserEvent`,
  `AssistantEvent`, `SystemEvent`, `ModeEvent`, and `OtherEvent` with full
  content blocks (text, thinking, tool_use, tool_result) and envelope
  metadata — no semantic filtering in the parser.
- `TranscriptDiscovery` with mtime-cursored incremental discovery.
- Pure-Python reference parser and a Rust fast-path (`_parser_rs`, PyO3 +
  rayon) with event-for-event parity, prefetch-bounded memory, and a
  `CC_TRANSCRIPT_DISABLE_RUST` escape hatch.
- Opt-in consumer-side filtering (`FilterConfig`), including
  `SENTIMENT_FILTER` reproducing cc-sentiment's exact drops.
- `FileStateStore`: a generic WAL/locked SQLite mtime ledger with atomic
  consumer transactions, for idempotent incremental scans.
